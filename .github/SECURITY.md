## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability please email me at chouse.samuel@gmail.com if
the vulnerability is severe or if it is minor, open up a bug report.

Once a vulnerability is reported, we will investigate and take action on it. If
we cannot replicate the vulnerability, the issue will be closed. If the issue is
confirmed there will be a security patch immediately or a patch will be added to
the next version of the project depending on the severity of the vulnerability.
